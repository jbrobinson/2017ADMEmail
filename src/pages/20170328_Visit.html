    <p>&ldquo;I chose to come to Waldorf because of the small town that is similar to where I grew up, and because of the staff. When I came on my visit, I remember that no matter where I was going, every faculty and staff member I passed had a smile on their face and seemed to really love it here. That made a huge impression on me!&rdquo;</p>

Waldorf University is a private, liberal arts school located in the heart of beautiful Forest City, Iowa. We are located centrally among seven of the Midwest’s most populated metropolitan regions – so you can experience the best of both worlds – the small-town charm of Forest City and the big city appeal of Des Moines, Chicago, Minneapolis and more – all within driving distance.

When you come to campus, you’ll receive a personal tour from one of our student ambassadors, meet with our admissions team and have the opportunity to speak to a professor in your field of study. If you’re interested in fine arts or athletics, you’ll have the opportunity to visit with a director or coach as well.

Just for visiting us, you’ll receive:
+	$500 travel grant
+	20% discount at the Waldorf Bookstore
+	Admittance to an athletic or fine art event
+	Complimentary lunch

We have an open house on Friday, April 21 that you won’t want to miss. For more information on this event, please visit [http://www.waldorf.edu/admissions/visit-waldorf](http://www.waldorf.edu/admissions/visit-waldorf?utm_source=NRCCUA&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=VisitCampus&utm_campaign=General)

So, come see how friendly we are in Forest City, Iowa – and take a walk in a Warrior’s shoes. **#WeAreWarriors**
