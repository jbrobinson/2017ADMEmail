#### Waldorf University offers over 35 clubs and organizations for its students to choose from.

One of the most exciting things about attending college is living on campus and taking part in all the activities. Beyond academics, our students are able to participate in activities from the biology, business or education clubs to creative writing and entrepreneurship organizations. We have over 35 clubs and organizations to choose from. Here are just a few:

**Service/Rotaract** – Partnering with the Rotary Organization – this group of dedicated students help design and implement service projects that positively impact themselves, the community and the world.  Our students participate in events like food packing, Coaches vs. Cancer, collecting school supplies for area schools and even raking leaves in our community. This is part of our mission at Waldorf and we are proud of our service on and around campus!

**Intramurals and Recreation** – Looking to stay active or attend a fun event off campus? Our Intramurals and Recreation program is for you. We offer a variety of sports like disc golf, basketball, volleyball, bowling, ping-pong, tennis, broomball and more. We also offer recreation trips to events like the NBA, WNBA, NFL, NHL, Arena Football, waterparks and laser tag.  You’ll also receive a membership to our YMCA (which is part of our campus) and provides you with a number of fitness options, like swimming, a weight/nautilus room, spinning, group classes, racquetball and more.

**Campus Ministries** – This active and engaged leadership group promotes spiritual development for students on campus. We are not affiliated with just one denomination, nor with just one way to worship. “Like Fire” meets weekly with high energy Christian music and deep discussion. We also have mass and rosary services. We understand that faith is a journey and it’s one you can continue at Waldorf.

**S.W.A.T.** – The Social Warrior Activities Team brings entertaining and interactive events for students to enjoy. Students can be involved in many ways with S.W.A.T. including hospitality, advertising and planning events. S.W.A.T. brings events such as comedians, coffeehouse artists, de-stress day programming, novelty acts and various other speakers and artists to the Waldorf campus.

Waldorf also offers societies like: **Alpha Chi** - to honor those with high academic achievement and use those gifts in service for others; **Alpha Psi Omega National Honor Society** – for students demonstrating excellence in theatre; **Mu Phi Epsilon** – the group recognizes those with excellence in music; and  **Lambda Alpha Epsilon**, **Iota Beta Phi** – a co-ed criminal justice fraternity that seeks to improve criminal justice at Waldorf through educational activities, while fostering professionalism in all areas of criminal justice.

Getting involved at Waldorf University is easy and fun!
