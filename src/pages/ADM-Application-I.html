In order to keep you moving forward during the application process, we need you to verify your application information. This step will prepare you for your complimentary evaluation. Once your evaluation is complete, you should be ready to get started with your first class!

Should you need assistance in obtaining your prior transcripts, we do offer a complimentary [Transcript Request Service](http://www.waldorf.edu/downloads/pdf/academics/online/transcript-request-service-form) at no cost to you. Submitting this form will allow us to attempt to obtain your official transcripts on your behalf.

When is a good time for me to reach out to you to verify your information and assist you with enrollment?

I look forward to your response and assisting you throughout the duration of your admissions process.

Sincerely,

**Waldorf University Admissions**
