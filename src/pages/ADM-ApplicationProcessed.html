#### Confirm Your Academic Institutions
Please verify the institutions listed on your application and your selected program of study. If the list below is not complete or is incorrect, please reply to this email with a list of the institutions previously attended. Note: Failure to disclose all academic institutions previously attended can result in denial of admission to Waldorf University.

(Insert Student&#39;s Previous Academic Institutions)

#### Verify Your Application

If you submitted your application by phone and have not logged into the portal to verify your application information, please complete this important step at this time. You may login to your [myWaldorf Applicant Portal](https://mywaldorf.waldorf.edu/prospect/t_blank) as an existing user and simply electronically sign and date your information.

#### Submit Your Transcripts

Waldorf offers a Transcript Request Service at no cost to you. Waldorf will attempt to obtain official domestic transcripts, including high school transcripts and GED results. If you are interested in utilizing this service, please complete and sign both [Transcript Request Service forms](http://www.waldorf.edu/downloads/pdf/academics/online/transcript-request-service-form.aspx) and return to [WAL-Transcripts@waldorf.edu](mailto:WAL-Transcripts@waldorf.edu) or via fax to (251) 224-0573.

Students may send copies of transcripts or documents during the initial admission period and enroll as a student on conditional status. Students enrolled under conditional status are allowed to complete up to 12 credit hours (undergraduate), or 6 credit hours (graduate), before official transcripts must be on file. All students using VA benefits must have official transcripts on file prior to their first enrollment.

A transcript is considered official only if it arrives at Waldorf University in a sealed envelope. If you receive your official document at your home address, please put it into another envelope and mail it to the address directly below. If the original envelope has been opened, it is no longer considered official and cannot be used.
