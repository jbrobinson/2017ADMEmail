## YOU DID IT!

Congratulations! You've completed your first term with Waldorf University, and that means you're one step closer to achieving your degree.

Use this momentum to blaze a trail into the next term. After all, the hard part is over. Charge forward with confidence knowing that the Waldorf staff is here to support you every step of the way.

We're excited to see you return! If you have not yet enrolled in your second term, allow me to assist or [Enroll Now](https://mywaldorf.waldorf.edu/student/ClassEnrollment).

Until then, celebrate this accomplishment with a great big victory cry. We are Warriors!

Sincerely,
