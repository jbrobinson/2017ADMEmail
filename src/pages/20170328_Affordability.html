#### Waldorf University has one of the most affordable tuition rates in Iowa.  Come check us out!

Deciding on a college is not easy. There are many factors that weigh into your decision – and cost is one of them. As a private, liberal arts school, Waldorf University has one of the most affordable tuition rates in Iowa – and across the nation.

Plus, we offer a number of scholarships to make your decision to come to Waldorf that much easier. We offer scholarships in the arts – like music and theatre, as well as our athletic programs. We are unique in that we offer a scholarship program specific to women interested in leadership. And, many students qualify for merit scholarships based on their academic performance.

Annually, we have two Scholarship Days where high school seniors can compete for one full tuition scholarship, one of five $2,000 scholarships or textbooks at no cost during your first semester. For more information on Scholarship Day including eligibility, please visit [Waldorf.edu/Scholarship-Day](http://waldorf.edu/scholarship-day?http://waldorf.edu/scholarship-day?utm_source=NRCCUA&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=Affordability&utm_campaign=General).
