#### Here’s your chance to be a Warrior!

At Waldorf University, you are more than just a student. You’ll become part of something much greater – you’ll be a Warrior!

For over 110 years, Waldorf University has been providing academic excellence to its students in the friendly, safe environment of Forest City, Iowa. We offer a broad range of academic programs, more than 35 clubs and organizations, fine arts and athletics. And, as a private, liberal arts school, Waldorf University has one of the most affordable tuition rates in Iowa – and across the nation.

Becoming a Warrior has its advantages. Here are just a few:

*	**Experience from day one.**<br />
 From your first day at Waldorf, you will start gaining experience in your field. Theatre major? We offer a freshman only performance (not all universities do this), and you can do things like design sets and costumes - as a freshman! Biology major? You’ll have access to four laboratories and be able to use equipment such as a GeoWall, PCR Thermocycler and more. What about communications? Whether it’s TV, radio, film or graphic design – you’ll get a chance to write, edit and produce – and use state-of-the-art technology that will serve you well in a career. At Waldorf – you don’t have to wait until you’re a junior or senior to start building your resume.

*	**One-on-one education.**<br /> With class sizes around 20 students, you’ll be able to have one-on-one communication with your professors and get the most out of each class. This also means when you graduate, you’ll walk away from Waldorf with a meaningful education and a degree you can be proud of.

*	**Be involved!**<br /> As a student, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in clubs and organizations even if they aren’t related to your major. For instance – if you’re a criminal justice major, but love radio – then you can participate in our student run station, KZOW 91.9. FM.  Student life will keep you busy, with such events like Homecoming, Winterfest, Campus Ministry, and more. You’ll be part of something at Waldorf – because after all – you’re a Warrior!

Come for a visit to see what Waldorf is all about! **#WeAreWarriors**
