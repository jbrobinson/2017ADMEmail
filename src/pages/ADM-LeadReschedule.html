## Dear (%firstname%),

Since we were unable to connect today, I would like to set up a time for us to discuss the admissions process when you are available.

Please let me know a time that works best for you and we can connect at your convenience. I am available Monday - Thursday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. CST. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

**Waldorf University Admissions**
