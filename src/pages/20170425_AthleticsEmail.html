Located in the heart of Forest City, Iowa, Waldorf University offers quality athletic and fine arts programs that will allow you to continue your passion after high school. Whether you’re on the field, court, mat, stage or in the performance hall – we think you’ll appreciate what our campus has to offer and find that our academic programs and student life make Waldorf University the right choice for you.

##### Athletics
Waldorf University’s athletic department encourages athletic, academic and professional excellence on a conference, regional and national level. As a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and the North Star Athletic Association (NSAA), our athletes focus on teamwork, integrity and service. With 20 programs to choose from, we promote academic, athletic and personal growth of our student-athletes to build Warriors!

We have impressive facilities too. Our football field, featuring artificial turf, is home to the football and soccer teams, and we recently added a new 8-lane track and state-of-the-art field event areas to this complex making it one of the best in this region. Our baseball and softball fields also feature artificial turf, while our Sports Performance Center and Hanson Fieldhouse, house our basketball and volleyball court, wrestling room and athletic training room. When you visit, you’ll get a better appreciation for these excellent facilities!

##### Fine Arts
We’re very proud of our fine arts programs at Waldorf! Our theatre department performs four mainstage productions a year and offers a Shakespeare minor – that’s unique to a university of our size.

Our vocal department is rich in history. Our Waldorf Choir is the second oldest collegiate a cappella choir in the U.S. We also offer two additional vocal ensembles: Sangkor, which means “song-choir” in Norwegian, is a Waldorf and Forest City community choir, and the Schola Cantorum, which translated from Latin means “singing school,” is a highly-selective chamber ensemble of mixed voices.

The instrumental music program offers a variety of opportunities from the Waldorf Wind Ensemble, Waldorf Jazz, the Warrior Pep Band (which you might find our president playing in from time to time) and the Warrior Drumline.

The music program at Waldorf is open to non-majors as well as majors. Our music department is also proud to be one of only two universities in Iowa to carry the distinction of being an All-Steinway School.

And, we will soon be breaking ground on a new $9.3 million Fine Arts Center that will enhance musical performances and experiences! This will be opening in 2018.

It’s an exciting time at Waldorf University! Come for a visit and see for yourself what Warriors are made of! **#WeAreWarriors**
